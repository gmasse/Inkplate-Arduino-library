   Inkplate6FLICK_Partial_Update example for Soldered Inkplate 6FLICK
   For this example you will need only USB cable and Inkplate 6FLICK
   Select "Soldered Inkplate 6FLICK" from Tools -> Board menu.
   Don't have "Soldered Inkplate 6FLICK" option? Follow our tutorial and add it:
   https://soldered.com/learn/add-inkplate-6-board-definition-to-arduino-ide/

   In this example we will show how to use partial update functionality of Inkplate 6FLICK e-paper display.
   It will scroll text that is saved in char array
   NOTE: Partial update is only available on 1 Bit mode (BW) and it is not recommended to use it on first refresh after
   power up. It is recommended to do a full refresh every 5-10 partial refresh to maintain good picture quality.
